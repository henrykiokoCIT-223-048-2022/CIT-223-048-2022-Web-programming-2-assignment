1. Write a simple program of the following output using Constants. 
 Employee code is 001 
 Employee Name is ABC 
 Employee Salary is 25000 
 Working Hours are 7.5 

	<?php
	define("EMPLOYEE_CODE", "001");
	define("EMPLOYEE_NAME", "ABC");
	define("EMPLOYEE_SALARY", 25000);
	define("WORKING_HOURS", 7.5);
	echo "Employee code is " . EMPLOYEE_CODE . "<br>";
	echo "Employee Name is " . EMPLOYEE_NAME . "<br>";
	echo "Employee Salary is " . EMPLOYEE_SALARY . "<br>";
	echo "Working Hours are " . WORKING_HOURS . "<br>";
	?>

2. Repeat the above program using Variables.  Hint:  Save the given data at 4 memory locations respectively and print on the screen.

	<?php
	$employee_code = "001";
	$employee_name = "ABC";
	$employee_salary = 25000;
	$working_hours = 7.5;
	echo "Employee code is " . $employee_code . "<br>";
	echo "Employee Name is " . $employee_name . "<br>";
	echo "Employee Salary is " . $employee_salary . "<br>";
	echo "Working Hours are " . $working_hours . "<br>";
	?>

3. How do you make a constant name case insensitive? 
	By adding a third parameter to the define() function and setting it to true. e.g define("EMPLOYEE_NAME", "ABC", true);


4. How do you declare a constant in PHP with example? 
	 using the define() function. 
	e.g: define("COMPANY_NAME", "Tech Solutions");

5. Write make a simple program to set your G.R No. and Name in the variables and display G.R 
No. and name by echo and print functions.

	<?php
	$gr_no = "GR12345";
	$name = "Henry Kioko";
	echo "G.R No: " . $gr_no . "<br>";
	echo "Name: " . $name . "<br>";
	print "G.R No: " . $gr_no . "<br>";
	print "Name: " . $name . "<br>";
	?>
