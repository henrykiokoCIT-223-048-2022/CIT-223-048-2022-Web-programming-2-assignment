    $age = intval($_POST['age']);
    $days = $age * 365;
    echo "You have lived approximately $days days.";

2.  Write a code to calculate and print percentage of a student where, 
 Total_Marks=400, Obtained_Marks=Sum of obtained marks of all 4 subjects 
  Percentage= (Obtained_Marks*100)/Total_Marks. 

	<?php
	$total_marks = 400;
	$subject1 =55;
	$subject2 =66;
	$subject3 =78;
	$subject4 =45;
	$obtained_marks =$subject1 + $subject2 + $subject3 + $subject4;
	echo "percentage= ".$obtained_marks * 100 /$total_marks, "%";
	?>


 

 
3. Write a code to input Temperature in Centigrade and convert to Fahrenheit.  
<html>
<head>
    <title>Temperature Conversion</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Convert Temperature from Centigrade to Fahrenheit</h2>
    <form action="" method="POST">
        <label for="celsius">Enter Temperature in Centigrade:</label>
        <input type="text" id="celsius" name="celsius" required>
        <input type="submit" value="Convert">
    </form>

    <?php
    if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
        $celsius = $_POST['celsius'];
        $fahrenheit = ($celsius * 9/5) + 32;
        echo "<h3>$celsius °C is equal to $fahrenheit °F</h3>";
    }
    ?>
</body>

4. If $A= 34 and $B=55 then solve the following Exercise; Also Justify your answer 
                 a)  $A= = 34 && $B = = 55  
       True. && means and, for it to be true both statements have to be true.  Both $A== 34 and $B==55 are correct statements

 b)  $A>=30 || $B<=50         
True. || means ‘or’, for it to be true at least one  statement has to be true $A>= 34 is a correct statement. 
 c)  $B= = 55 || $A= =35 
True. || means ‘or’, for it to be true at least one  statement has to be true $B==55 is a correct statement.                
d)  $A !=34           
False. != means not equal. The statement $A !=34 is false because $A is equal to 34                          
 e)   $A>=30 && $A<35        
True. && means and, for it to be true, both statements have to be true.  Both $A>= 30 and $A<35 are correct statements
 f)  $B>50 || $B<56  
True. || means ‘or’, for it to be true at least one  statement has to be true. Both $B>50 and $B<56 are correct 





5. Mention the output of the following code at each step 
<?php						Output
$a = 33; 
$b = 55;  
$a += $b; 				$a = 33 + 55 = 88
$c = $a;  				$c = 88
$c -= $b; 				$c = 88 - 55 = 33
$c *= $a; 				$c = 33 * 88 = 2904
$a++;     				$a = 88 + 1 = 89
echo "a=$a ,b=$b , c=$c";  		 $a=89 ,$b=55, $c=2904




6. What is the result after the execution of the following program segment?
<?php 
$a = 8; 
$b = ++$a + 5; 
$c = $b-- + 10; 
echo "a= $a , b= $b , c = $c "; ?> 

answer: $a= 9 , $b= 13 , $c = 24




7. Write down the output of following code and also justify your answer 
a) echo 4 + 2 - 12 * 3 ; //what will be output 
-30.
 According to the order of operations (PEMDAS), multiplication is done before addition and subtraction. 
•  First, calculate 12*3: 12∗3=3612 * 3 = 3612∗3=36
•  Now substitute that back into the expression:
4+2−364 + 2 - 364+2−36
•  Calculate from left to right:
4+2=64 + 2 = 64+2=6
6−36=−306 - 36 = -306−36= −30


b) echo 4 + (2 – 12) * 3 ; //what will be output
- 26 
•  The expression inside the parentheses is calculated first.
• Calculate 2-12:    2−12=−102 - 12 = -102−12=−10
•  Substitute that back into the expression: 4+(−10)∗34 + (-10) * 34+(−10)∗3
•  Now perform the multiplication:−10∗3=−30-10 * 3 = -30−10∗3=−30
•  Finally, calculate: 4−30 = −264 - 30 = -264−30= −26

c) echo ( (4 + 2) - 12 ) * 3 //what will be output 
-18
•  Start with the operation inside the innermost parentheses:
•  Calculate 4+2: 4+2=64 + 2 = 64+2=6
•  Substitute that back into the expression: (6−12)∗3(6 - 12) * 3(6−12)∗3
•  Now calculate the expression in the parentheses:6−12=−66 - 12 = -66−12=−6
•  Finally, multiply by 3:  −6∗3=  − 18-6 * 3 = -18−6∗3= −18




8. What value is assigned to $ReturnValue for each of the following expression. 
a) $ReturnValue = 2 == 3;      bool(false)
b) $returnValue = "2" + "3";           int(5)
c ) $ReturnValue = 2 > 3;        bool(false)
d) $ReturnValue = 2 < 3;          bool(true)
e ) $ReturnValue = (2 > 3 ) && ( 2 < 3):          bool(false)
 f) $ReturnValue = (2 > 3 ) || (2 < 3 )                bool(true)
